Developed bidirectional person counter using two ultrasonic sensors and LCD display. Sensors send and receive signals and measure the distance between themselves and 
an object in front of them. The solution is designed to move the sensors 30 cm away from each other and to set a limited distance of 30 cm between the sensor and an 
object that the sensor will detect. Passing from sensor1 to sensor2 means entry, and from sensor2 to sensor1 means exit. When one sensor is activated, the other one 
waits for changes in the distance for 3 seconds. In order to increase/decrease the number on the LED display, it is necessary to pass both sensors. In any other case, 
the number on the LCD display will remain the same.
